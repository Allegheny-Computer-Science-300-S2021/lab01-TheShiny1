### First Tool
FastQC

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 The kind of research that this tool is used for is to check the quality control on raw sequences generate from high throughput sequencing pipelines

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 It creates large amounts of sequences to draw biological conclusions from. It provides a QC report which can spot problems which originate either in the sequencer or in the starting library material.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 To ensure that the raw data looks good and that there are no problems or biases in the data which can affect how it can be used.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

### Second Tool
European Nucleotide Archive
 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 Provides a comprehensive record on DNA and RNA raw sequencing and assembly data.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool is essentially a database. What it does is store information that is provided to it in a manner that can be accessed by other individuals who are researching the subject and need past information to compare analysis

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 So that people can easily access prior information on a subject to see whether its been researched or not and how well researched it is as well.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
